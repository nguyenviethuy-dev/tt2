### `rn-primitives`

RNR components are built on top of universal _(iOS, Android, and Web)_ style agnostic _(can be used with any styling system)_ [react-native primitives](https://rn-primitives.vercel.app/) which use [radix-ui/primitives](https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives) for the web.

### Deprecated-UI

[See screenshots](/packages/reusables/src/components/deprecated-ui/README.md)

The first draft of components with little to no focus on the web. The code remains for those who may still want to use it.

#### Community Templates
