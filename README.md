## WIP

Work in progress...

### Plan

- Make accessible components for React-Native applications that can be copy/pasted
- Will require additional libraries
- Most components to be compatible with Expo Go, while others will require [expo-dev-client](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- Might offer alternatives for components that cannot be used in Expo Go
