## Universal [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com) for React Native

Crafted with [NativeWind v4](https://www.nativewind.dev/v4/overview) and accessibility in mind, `react-native-reusables` is open source, offering a foundation for developing your own high-quality component library.

### How to use

**For your own project:**

1. Start with a template or manually setup configuration: [Check out the docs](https://rnr-docs.vercel.app/getting-started/initial-setup/)

2. Copy/paste what you need into your project (2 options)

    - Follow instructions in [docs](https://rnr-docs.vercel.app/) **(work in progress)**
    - Browse [`packages/reusables/src/components/ui/*`](packages/reusables/src/components/ui)
      1. Copy file in your project to `~/components/ui/*`
      2. If it uses a primitive, replace `@rnr/*` with `~/components/primitives/*`
      3. Copy the primitive to `~/components/primitives/*`
        - _If the primitive uses other primitives repeat steps 2 and 3._
