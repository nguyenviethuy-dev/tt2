</Card>

### Features
- **Universal**: Components, hooks, and utilities for Android, iOS, and the web applications.
- **Accessibility**: Built with accessibility in mind. Using [radix-ui/primitives](https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives) for the web and re-usable react-native primitives.
- **Incremental adoption**: Use as much or as little as you need at your own pace.
- **Code sharing**: Share code between web and native applications.
- **Customization**: The code lives in your project, not in your `node_modules` folder. You can customize it to your heart's content.
- **Dark mode**: Re-usable css variables for light and dark modes.

### How to use

1. [Use a template or manually setup configuration](/getting-started/initial-setup)
2. [Browse and copy/paste into your project](/components/accordion)
3. Customize the code to suit your specific requirements

<Aside>
  Most components are built using primitives. This means that you will also need to copy/paste the associated primitive in your project.

### The `react-native-reusables` way

This project aims to provide as little opinionated code as possible. However, some opinionated code is necessary to provide a consistent and easy-to-use experience.

- The CSS variable names are based on shadcn/ui's naming convention.
- Folder structure:

  - `@rn-primitives` for unstyled accessible components which uses [radix-ui/primitives](https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives) for the web.
  - `~/components/ui` for components styled with NativeWind. Most of these components are built using the primitives components.
  - `~/lib` for utilities, hooks, and constants.
