[shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com) for React Native with the purpose to be used to build your own component libraries. Copy, paste, and tailor the code to suit your specific requirements.

### How to use

1. [Install and set up NativeWind in your project](/getting-started/installation#install-nativewind)
2. [Add light and dark mode colors](/getting-started/installation#add-light-and-dark-mode-colors)
3. [Install and set up utilities](/getting-started/installation#install-and-set-up-utilities)
4. [Set up your tailwind config and the navigation theme](/getting-started/installation#configure-colors)
5. [Browse the components and copy/paste the code into your project for your given use case](/components/accordion)

### Foundational principles

This project's goal is to provide as little opinionated code as possible. However, some opinionated code is necessary to provide a consistent and easy-to-use experience.

- The CSS variable names are based on shadcn/ui's naming convention. If you were to use different variable names, you would need to change the CSS variable names in the components that you copy/paste.
- Folder structure:

  - `components/primitives` for unstyled accessible components which uses [radix-ui/primitives](https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives) for the web.
  - `components/ui` for components styled with NativeWind. Most of these components are built using the primitives components.
  - `lib` for utilities, hooks, and constants.
